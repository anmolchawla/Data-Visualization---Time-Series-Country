# INF 554 Assignment 2

## Description 
Assignment 2. Use UN Data for the same 10 countries of Assignment 1 to create a bubble cloud with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org). Recreate the same bubble cloud using using SVG code (i.e., writing SVG yourself not the SVG created by Inkscape!) and using javascript (i.e., dynamically generating the SVG). Use node.js to develop and document your set-up in the README.md.

## Rubric

| 	            | Development  	| SVG prototype	| SVG code | Dynamic SVG |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated	| Demonstrated use of node.js and sound Web development techniques, well documented, shows proficiency in using git (4-5 pts)| Prototype is well thought showing both relations and quantities (4-5 pts)| Code cleanly written and debugged (4-5 pts)| Code cleanly written and debugged (4-5 pts)|
| Competent	    | Not using or not demonstrated use of node.js and Web development techniques, some documentation, shows some proficiency in using git (2-3 pts) | Prototype shows some thought and/or showing some relations and quantities (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts)|
| Needs work	  | Not using node.js and Web editor, poorly or not documented, not using git appropriately (0-1 pts)| Prototype not well thought and/or not showing relations and quantities (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts)|
