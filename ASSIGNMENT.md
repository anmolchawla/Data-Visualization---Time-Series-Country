# INF 554 Assignment 2

## Description 
Assignment 2. Use UN Data for the same 10 countries of Assignment 1 to create a bubble cloud with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org). Recreate the same bubble cloud using using SVG code (i.e., writing SVG yourself not the SVG created by Inkscape!) and using javascript (i.e., dynamically generating the SVG). Use node.js to develop and document your set-up in the README.md.
