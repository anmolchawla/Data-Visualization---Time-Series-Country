# INF 554 Assignment 2

## Description 

* Pick one attribute from UN Data for the same 10 countries of your Assignment 1 and create a bubble cloud with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) as an SVG prototype.
* Manually recreate the same bubble cloud using SVG code (i.e., writing SVG yourself, not the SVG created by Inkscape!).
* In addition, recreate the same bubble cloud using JavaScript (i.e., dynamically generating the SVG).
* Use node.js to develop and **document** your set-up in `README.md`. There should be a detailed description on how to start the web server from inside the repo.
* Put all three images on an HTML page called `index.html`.
