# INF 554 Assignment 2

## Description 

Create and publish a bubble cloud in three different ways. Use node.js to develop. Document your set-up in `README.md`, i.e., explain how to start the web server. 

Create three bubble charts in one HTML document:
* **SVG Prototype**: pick one attribute from UN Data for the same 10 countries of your Assignment 1 and create a bubble cloud with [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) as an SVG prototype in `prototype.svg`. Put in `index.html`.
* **SVG Code**: manually recreate the same bubble cloud by writing SVG code in `index.html` (i.e., writing SVG yourself, not re-using the SVG created by Inkscape!). Use a `style.css` file.
* **Dynamic SVG**: recreate the same bubble cloud using JavaScript (i.e., dynamically generating the SVG). Use a `chart.js` file.
* Describe your data and charts as needed in the page.

## Rubric

| 	            | Development  	| SVG prototype	| SVG code | Dynamic SVG |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Sophisticated	| Demonstrated use of node.js and sound Web development techniques, well documented, shows proficiency in using git (4-5 pts)| Prototype is well thought out showing both relations and quantities (4-5 pts)| Code cleanly written and debugged (4-5 pts)| Code cleanly written and debugged (4-5 pts)|
| Competent	    | Not using or not demonstrated use of node.js and Web development techniques, some documentation, shows some proficiency in using git (2-3 pts) | Prototype shows some thoughts and/or showing some relations and quantities (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts)| Code cleanly written with minor problems (2-3 pts)|
| Needs work	  | Not using node.js and Web editor, poorly or not documented, not using git appropriately (0-1 pts)| Prototype is not well thought out and/or not showing relations and quantities (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts)| Code not well written and/or not debugged (0-1 pts)|


## Homework Guidelines
- Homework to be submitted in a week's time *before* the start of class.
- Late homework policy: 10% penalty over the total grade for the assignment for each late day (including the day of the course when the homework is due).
- Commits *after* the submission deadline will not count towards the grade unless requested (late policy may apply).
- Homework is expected to work in: SAFARI AND CHROME (Mac), IE (MS Edge) AND CHROME (Windows)
