# INF 554 Assignment 2

Update this README as needed.

This assignment is based on the same data of the previous assignment.
For this assignment only one year from the countries-population-time data was selected.

As China, India and United states operate on a different magnitude, the bubble chart to show the countries based on text and colour, with their radius corresponding to the "Normalized"
 value (1 - 100)  was selcted. As previously mentioned since there scale was different the text had to be made transparent in order to show the viewer the differnce in the magnitudes.

For this assignment, a seperate Javascript and CSS file were created in addition to the index.html.

The first step was to install and run node.js so that a local server can be created on the system that could allow a continous sync while editing, hence saying valuable time.

As I was previously involved in web development for another class, I had Node Js pre - installed as shown below.

After that NPM was installed to allow for browser sync, as shown below.

Git was cloned to a local desktop and a commit was made to ensure everything was on the Clasroom page.
